This module adds a typology for the sales orders and a new Blanket
Orter Type that allows grouping of Sales Order Types. For each 
Sales Order type, you can define, invoicing and refunding journal, 
a warehouse, a sequence, the shipping policy, the invoicing policy, 
a payment term, a pricelist and an incoterm. The blanket order shares 
similar attributes that can then be passed down to the Sales Order 
Type. 

You can see sale types as lines of business and Blanket Orders as
purchase agrreements from your customers.

You are able to select a sales order type by partner so that when you add a
partner to a sales order it will get the related info to it.
