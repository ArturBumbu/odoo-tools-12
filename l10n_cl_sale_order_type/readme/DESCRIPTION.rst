This module is a modified fork from the original OCA module 
(sale_order_type). This module adds a typology for the sale 
orders and a new object, Blanket Orter Type, that allows grouping 
of Sales Order Types. 

For each Sale Order type, you can define, invoicing and refunding 
journal, a warehouse, a sequence, the shipping policy, the invoicing 
policy, a payment term, a pricelist and an incoterm. You are able 
to select a sales order type by partner so that when you add a
partner to a sales order it will get the related info to it.

The blanket order shares similar attributes that can then be passed 
down to the Sales Order Type. 

You can see sale types as lines of business and Blanket Orders as
purchase agreements from your customers.

Both Sale Order Type and Blanket Orders are maintained in the Sales app
Configuration menu.
